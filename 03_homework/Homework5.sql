-- Cross Join
/*1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** 
customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? 
Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

HINT: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. 
Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. 
Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)?
How many customers are there (y). 
Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x*y).  */

First, add a new column, current_quantity to the table using the following syntax.

Then, using UPDATE, change the current_quantity equal to the last quantity value from the vendor_inventory details.

HINT: This one is pretty hard. 
First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. 
Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) 
Third, SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...), remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. 
Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, 
	you'll need to use product_units.product_id to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. 
When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement. */
