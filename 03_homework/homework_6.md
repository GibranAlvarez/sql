**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

The First thing that comes to my mind in terms of ethics is related to the customer data related to their purchases and their personal information like name and address. The line between tracking consumer behaviour for marketing purposes and engaging can easily fade into intrusive surveillance and depending on the owner of the data the detailed purchase histories, store visits and personal information can facilitate tracking individuals' movements and behaviours and therefore violating their privacy rights. Therefore, a strong regulatory oversight of businesses is needed in relation to consent and transparency on the use of such data.

Another important question is related to the ownership of these type of databases, given that this information is used to obtain financial gain by businesses regulation should specify who the owner of the data is and from there determine the rights of use and storing of customers and businesses.

One relevant aspect of data interpretation is that it can produce biased results that not necessarily represent reality but rather the result of state policies (intended or not), for example the proportion of incarcerated people by race in respect to their total population. Even though that this might imply that a certain 'race' commits more crime this might not take into account the over policing on BIPOC people, the lack of public infrastructure for these communities and the lack of access to services that might improve their material conditions.

In conclusion a robust oversight on businesses is necessary to produce the necessary transparency of the use of the data. From the part of data scientists is crucial to have relevant training about the social impacts that their work can produce, a clear understanding on biases that exists already on society and how those biases may impact their databases and correctly identify the limits of their analysis with such databases.
